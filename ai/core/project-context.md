# Project context

Hecate is an open-source AI gateway and agent-task runtime. A single Go binary embeds the React operator UI, mediates OpenAI- and Anthropic-shaped client traffic to upstream LLM providers, runs queued `agent_loop` tasks with policy and approval gates, and emits OpenTelemetry traces for everything it does. It is tenant-aware, deny-by-default, runtime-aware, and storage-tiered (memory / sqlite / postgres). Every endpoint, config knob, and error message exists to answer five operator questions: what did the gateway just decide, why, what did it cost, what happens on the next failure, and where is the trace.

## Architecture rings

The codebase has three concentric rings; cross-ring imports go inward only:

- **`pkg/types/`** — public types, no `internal/` imports. The wire-shape contract.
- **`internal/api/`** — inbound HTTP shapes + handlers. Translates HTTP requests into internal types; never touches providers directly.
- **`internal/providers/`** — outbound HTTP per provider (OpenAI-compat, Anthropic). Translates internal types to provider wire shapes. Never imports `internal/api/`.
- **`internal/orchestrator/`** — task runtime (queue, runner, `agent_loop`, sandbox boundary). Sits above providers, called by api.
- **`internal/<feature>/`** — gateway services (governor, router, cache, retention, taskstate, mcp, …). Each owns one concern.

The api↔providers parallel-struct duplication (`OpenAIChatMessage` ↔ `openAIChatMessage`) is **intentional**. It keeps `internal/providers/` free of `internal/api/` imports and lets the wire shapes evolve independently. See [`../skills/providers/SKILL.md`](../skills/providers/SKILL.md) for full reasoning.

## Storage tier rule

Every backend-bound concern (cache, taskstate, chatstate, governor, retention history) ships with three tiers, mirrored exactly:

- `memory` — in-process, default, perfect for `go test` and `make dev`.
- `sqlite` — single-file persistence via `modernc.org/sqlite` (no CGO).
- `postgres` — production scale via `pgx`.

When adding a new persisted thing, mirror all three. Add a `<thing>_test.go` that runs against memory and sqlite (postgres is structurally identical SQL — covered transitively).

## Toolchain pins

- **Go**: see `go.mod` for the exact pinned version. CGO is not used; `modernc.org/sqlite` is the pure-Go sqlite driver.
- **UI package manager**: Bun (pinned via `packageManager` in `ui/package.json`). The lockfile is `bun.lock`; there is no `package-lock.json`. Use `bun install`, `bun run <script>`, `bun add <pkg>`, `bun x <tool>`. Do not introduce npm/yarn/pnpm lockfiles or workflow steps.
- **UI stack**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Vitest + Testing Library + jsdom. Plain CSS with design tokens in `ui/src/styles.css` — no CSS-in-JS, no utility-class framework.
- **Critical command distinction**: `bun run test` ≠ `bun test`. The latter skips the testing-library DOM setup and panics with `document[isPrepared]` errors. Always `bun run test` (which dispatches to vitest).

## Risky and sensitive areas

These earn extra scrutiny; changes here are not drive-by territory.

- **Sandbox boundary** (`internal/sandbox`, `cmd/sandboxd`) — out-of-process tool execution. A buggy tool must not be able to crash the gateway. Layer 1 (env sanitisation, output cap, rlimits) and Layer 2 (OS-level network isolation, opt-in via `GATEWAY_SANDBOX_OS_ISOLATION`) are both shipped. New isolation capabilities follow the build-tagged per-platform pattern in `exec_isolation_*.go` and `exec_rlimit_*.go`. See `docs/sandbox.md` for the full isolation-layer model.
- **Approval lifecycle** (`internal/taskstate`, `awaiting_approval`) — pre-execution and mid-loop approvals halt the run. New gates use the same `TaskApproval` shape.
- **Retention worker** (`internal/retention`) — high-cardinality history sweep. Subsystems: `traces`, `budget`, `audit`, `cache`, `turn_events`. Persisted things must mirror.
- **Cost ledger** — all money is `int64` micro-USD (`1_000_000` = `$1`). Never `float64`.
- **Tenant scoping** — automatic once the request has a tenant principal. New endpoints must respect it; admin-path bypass is forbidden. Multi-tenant *management* (Tenants/Keys tabs, tenant API keys) is opt-in via `GATEWAY_MULTI_TENANT=true`; the published Docker image defaults to single-user. Three observability surfaces have a tenant-readable mirror under `/v1/*` (`/v1/runtime/stats`, `/v1/traces`, `/v1/requests`) — these share the private body with the matching `/admin/*` handler.
- **Bootstrap-token handshake** — `GET /v1/bootstrap-token` is loopback-only and same-origin-fenced (Origin host must match Host *or* be a loopback hostname so Vite dev `localhost:5173` -> `127.0.0.1:8765` works). Refuses when `GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN` is operator-supplied. Wire envelope is `{object: "bootstrap_token", data: {token}}` like the rest of the API — UI clients that read top-level fields will silently fail.
